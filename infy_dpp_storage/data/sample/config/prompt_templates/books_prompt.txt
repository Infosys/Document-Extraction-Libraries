Please use the provided context to answer the question. If you are unsure or do not know the answer, simply state that you do not know. Do not attempt to fabricate an answer. Your response should be formatted as a JSON object, like this: "key1":"value1","key2":"value2". The <key> represents the specific characteristic requested in the question, and the <value> is the corresponding information extracted from the context. Please ensure all keys are in lowercase and values should be in Camel Case and with dot after initials(e.g: H. G. Wells) if they are proper nouns. Also, all keys and values should be in double quotes. Do not give any string or key before the JSON object, only give me the JSON object as output.
