            "Letter to the Shareholder Dear shareholder, Financial year 2023 was a strong year for our business. In FY23, we saw growth of over 15%, operating margins  of 21%, and free cash flow of US$2.5 billion. Our attrition  reduced for each quarter of the year. With the changing economic environment, we positioned  our Company to work with clients for their digital  transformation as well as their cost efficiency and  automation programs, enabling us to support them in two  critical areas of interest. We have developed a strong set of capabilities in  generative artificial intelligence to enhance how we enable  our clients to derive value. These capabilities are available  to all our clients in the form of Infosys TopazTM. Our Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate  with our clients. Our platforms, including Finacle for banks,  McCamish for insurance, Equinox for commerce, and Helix  for healthcare, are creating strong impact with clients.  During the year, we were recognized by Brand Finance  among the top three most valuable IT services brands  globally. We continue to deepen our engagement with our clients.  The number of clients with over US$100 million in revenue  for the year was at 40. The number of clients with over  US$50 million in revenue for the year was at 75. Our large  deal intensity was strong during the year. We had 95 large  deals with a value of US$9.8 billion in the year. We see  our One Infosys approach helping support our clients by  bringing all our capabilities and the strength of our entire  employee-base to work for their benefit. We recruited over 50,000 college graduates in the year and  ended the year with over 3,40,000 employees. At the end  of the year, 39% of our employees were women.\nOur learning ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning  days for our employees during the year.  Last year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders –  US$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our  share buyback program. At the end of the financial year, we were the leading  company among our peers in total shareholder return over  the past five years. We remain committed to the communities we live and  operate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we  support a variety of social causes, including creating  positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and  women empowerment. Our Infosys Springboard initiative  continues to help build digital skills by providing free  learning programs to millions of people around the world. In the past few quarters, we have seen the global  economy dealing with inflation, interest rate increases,  and changes in demand environment for companies in  various industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in  automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have  held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in  the evolving economic environment. As I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the  dedication of our employees, the strength of our  capabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance  of our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our  clients and continue to create impact for them.

            "Chairman's message\nNavigating uncertainty If there is one overriding theme that defines our current  world, it is that it is suffused with uncertainty. The placid  and the predictable are behind us as each new day brings  new inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted  models we have constructed of the world around us. The  cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand  volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency  to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without  warning, is what's before us. In any week, we may oscillate  from caution to optimism and back to caution based on  the news of the day.  Such times of intense uncertainty, great short-term  pressure, and crunched resources require that companies  must become better, more efficient in their ability to be  resilient in the present while also securing their future  growth. This is easier said than done. The extreme volatility  that surrounds us creates so many probable future states,  that it simply isn't prudent for businesses to plan to  succeed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we  need to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting  choices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn  to thrive in any new reality.  The era of optionality is upon us. Optionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure,  it is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we  work – remotely, in office or hybrid. In the area of talent, it  is about building and deploying agile learning platforms  so that our people can hone their skill sets to match  new demand and new technologies. It is about having a  digital-first and AI-first business architecture which can  be constantly configured. It is finding the right balance  between retaining the core of a company and working  with partners on others. Optionality must be ingrained in  strategy and execution. Our CEO, Salil Parekh, and his global leadership team,  realized early on the value that advanced digital  technologies like AI and cloud, and more recently,  generative AI, can bring to imagine and execute for  multiple options in the future. They came together as  One Infosys to orchestrate teams that lead the charge to  continually transform Infosys into an organization that truly  realizes human-machine synergies, from fundamentally  rethinking organizational design to segmenting cognitive  tasks to get the right balance between people, technology,  and process. Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards  a future where we don't just solve immediate business\nproblems, but continually innovate and architect for  challenges that may emerge in the future. We build it  for ourselves first, and then, deeply rooted in our own  experience, take it widely to our clients.  The awesome possibilities of generative AI, we know from  our own journey to becoming an AI-first enterprise, is not  without its risks. The problems of AI hallucination, systemic  biases, lack of explainability along with plenty of practical,  ethical and intellectual property-related issues remain open  and up for debate. We also know, from our experience,  that the path to scaling AI enterprise-wide is non-linear.  Often, organizations, seeking to mine value from data and  AI models, successfully undertake pilots but fail to factor in  what it will take to scale value across the whole enterprise.  As demands increase, data volumes grow, and complexity  rises, companies find themselves unable to surmount the  associated challenges and start to question the path to  value. Navigating to value-at-scale from AI and retaining  the larger strategic vision while breaking down the tasks  into sequential small wins, is not always intuitive or simple.  With our AI-first strategy, Infosys is guided by that road  map. We are also bringing to our global clients the ability  to accelerate business value and amplify human potential  using AI technologies with Infosys TopazTM. The digital transformation of every industry and every  business, over the last several years, has laid the foundation  to create optionality as we navigate the way forward.  Our clients have always trusted us to assist them not only  to make the right digital investments but to safeguard  these investments for their future. Today, we are excited  by the opportunity and humbled by the responsibility we  have to enable them to bring all their digital capabilities  together to execute quickly and effectively for now, while  developing multiple options to amplify their competitive  advantage and market leadership in an uncertain future.  Our client relevance has never been so compelling, our  investment in employees as continuous and consistent,  and our purpose so keen. We are ready to co-create with  our clients and our entire ecosystem a flexible future that  puts people first and benefits the broader society even as  it propels business forward. After all, like many have said,  imagination is our invisible power to create all things. Our  future can be as bright as we imagine it to be. Nandan M. Nilekani Bengaluru May 29, 2023 Chairman\nNandan M. Nilekani Chairman"

The  cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand  volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency  to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without  warning, is what's before us. In any week, we may oscillate  from caution to optimism and back to caution based on  the news of the day.  Such times of intense uncertainty, great short-term  pressure, and crunched resources require that companies  must become better, more efficient in their ability to be  resilient in the present while also securing their future  growth. This is easier said than done. The extreme volatility  that surrounds us creates so many probable future states,  that it simply isn't prudent for businesses to plan to  succeed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we  need to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting  choices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn  to thrive in any new reality.  The era of optionality is upon us. Optionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure,  it is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we  work – remotely, in office or hybrid.

Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards  a future where we don't just solve immediate business\nproblems, but continually innovate and architect for  challenges that may emerge in the future. We build it  for ourselves first, and then, deeply rooted in our own  experience, take it widely to our clients.  The awesome possibilities of generative AI, we know from  our own journey to becoming an AI-first enterprise, is not  without its risks. The problems of AI hallucination, systemic  biases, lack of explainability along with plenty of practical,  ethical and intellectual property-related issues remain open  and up for debate. We also know, from our experience,  that the path to scaling AI enterprise-wide is non-linear.  Often, organizations, seeking to mine value from data and  AI models, successfully undertake pilots but fail to factor in  what it will take to scale value across the whole enterprise.  As demands increase, data volumes grow, and complexity  rises, companies find themselves unable to surmount the  associated challenges and start to question the path to  value. Navigating to value-at-scale from AI and retaining  the larger strategic vision while breaking down the tasks  into sequential small wins, is not always intuitive or simple.  With our AI-first strategy, Infosys is guided by that road  map. We are also bringing to our global clients the ability  to accelerate business value and amplify human potential  using AI technologies with Infosys TopazTM. The digital transformation of every industry and every  business, over the last several years, has laid the foundation  to create optionality as we navigate the way forward.  Our clients have always trusted us to assist them not only  to make the right digital investments but to safeguard  these investments for their future. Today, we are excited  by the opportunity and humbled by the responsibility we  have to enable them to bring all their digital capabilities  together to execute quickly and effectively for now, while  developing multiple options to amplify their competitive  advantage and market leadership in an uncertain future.  Our client relevance has never been so compelling, our  investment in employees as continuous and consistent,  and our purpose so keen. We are ready to co-create with  our clients and our entire ecosystem a flexible future that  puts people first and benefits the broader society even as  it propels business forward. After all, like many have said,  imagination is our invisible power to create all things. Our  future can be as bright as we imagine it to be. Nandan M.

            "Letter to the Shareholder Dear shareholder, Financial year 2023 was a strong year for our business. In FY23, we saw growth of over 15%, operating margins  of 21%, and free cash flow of US$2.5 billion. Our attrition  reduced for each quarter of the year. With the changing economic environment, we positioned  our Company to work with clients for their digital  transformation as well as their cost efficiency and  automation programs, enabling us to support them in two  critical areas of interest. We have developed a strong set of capabilities in  generative artificial intelligence to enhance how we enable  our clients to derive value. These capabilities are available  to all our clients in the form of Infosys TopazTM. Our Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate  with our clients. Our platforms, including Finacle for banks,  McCamish for insurance, Equinox for commerce, and Helix  for healthcare, are creating strong impact with clients.  During the year, we were recognized by Brand Finance  among the top three most valuable IT services brands  globally. We continue to deepen our engagement with our clients.  The number of clients with over US$100 million in revenue  for the year was at 40. The number of clients with over  US$50 million in revenue for the year was at 75. Our large  deal intensity was strong during the year. We had 95 large  deals with a value of US$9.8 billion in the year. We see  our One Infosys approach helping support our clients by  bringing all our capabilities and the strength of our entire  employee-base to work for their benefit. We recruited over 50,000 college graduates in the year and  ended the year with over 3,40,000 employees. At the end  of the year, 39% of our employees were women.\nOur learning ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning  days for our employees during the year.  Last year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders –  US$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our  share buyback program. At the end of the financial year, we were the leading  company among our peers in total shareholder return over  the past five years. We remain committed to the communities we live and  operate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we  support a variety of social causes, including creating  positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and  women empowerment. Our Infosys Springboard initiative  continues to help build digital skills by providing free  learning programs to millions of people around the world. In the past few quarters, we have seen the global  economy dealing with inflation, interest rate increases,  and changes in demand environment for companies in  various industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in  automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have  held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in  the evolving economic environment. As I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the  dedication of our employees, the strength of our  capabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance  of our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our  clients and continue to create impact for them.

            "Chairman's message\nNavigating uncertainty If there is one overriding theme that defines our current  world, it is that it is suffused with uncertainty. The placid  and the predictable are behind us as each new day brings  new inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted  models we have constructed of the world around us. The  cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand  volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency  to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without  warning, is what's before us. In any week, we may oscillate  from caution to optimism and back to caution based on  the news of the day.  Such times of intense uncertainty, great short-term  pressure, and crunched resources require that companies  must become better, more efficient in their ability to be  resilient in the present while also securing their future  growth. This is easier said than done. The extreme volatility  that surrounds us creates so many probable future states,  that it simply isn't prudent for businesses to plan to  succeed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we  need to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting  choices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn  to thrive in any new reality.  The era of optionality is upon us. Optionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure,  it is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we  work – remotely, in office or hybrid. In the area of talent, it  is about building and deploying agile learning platforms  so that our people can hone their skill sets to match  new demand and new technologies. It is about having a  digital-first and AI-first business architecture which can  be constantly configured. It is finding the right balance  between retaining the core of a company and working  with partners on others. Optionality must be ingrained in  strategy and execution. Our CEO, Salil Parekh, and his global leadership team,  realized early on the value that advanced digital  technologies like AI and cloud, and more recently,  generative AI, can bring to imagine and execute for  multiple options in the future. They came together as  One Infosys to orchestrate teams that lead the charge to  continually transform Infosys into an organization that truly  realizes human-machine synergies, from fundamentally  rethinking organizational design to segmenting cognitive  tasks to get the right balance between people, technology,  and process. Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards  a future where we don't just solve immediate business\nproblems, but continually innovate and architect for  challenges that may emerge in the future. We build it  for ourselves first, and then, deeply rooted in our own  experience, take it widely to our clients.  The awesome possibilities of generative AI, we know from  our own journey to becoming an AI-first enterprise, is not  without its risks. The problems of AI hallucination, systemic  biases, lack of explainability along with plenty of practical,  ethical and intellectual property-related issues remain open  and up for debate. We also know, from our experience,  that the path to scaling AI enterprise-wide is non-linear.  Often, organizations, seeking to mine value from data and  AI models, successfully undertake pilots but fail to factor in  what it will take to scale value across the whole enterprise.  As demands increase, data volumes grow, and complexity  rises, companies find themselves unable to surmount the  associated challenges and start to question the path to  value. Navigating to value-at-scale from AI and retaining  the larger strategic vision while breaking down the tasks  into sequential small wins, is not always intuitive or simple.  With our AI-first strategy, Infosys is guided by that road  map. We are also bringing to our global clients the ability  to accelerate business value and amplify human potential  using AI technologies with Infosys TopazTM.

            "Chairman's message\nNavigating uncertainty If there is one overriding theme that defines our current  world, it is that it is suffused with uncertainty. The placid  and the predictable are behind us as each new day brings  new inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted  models we have constructed of the world around us. The  cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand  volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency  to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without  warning, is what's before us. In any week, we may oscillate  from caution to optimism and back to caution based on  the news of the day.  Such times of intense uncertainty, great short-term  pressure, and crunched resources require that companies  must become better, more efficient in their ability to be  resilient in the present while also securing their future  growth. This is easier said than done. The extreme volatility  that surrounds us creates so many probable future states,  that it simply isn't prudent for businesses to plan to  succeed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we  need to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting  choices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn  to thrive in any new reality.  The era of optionality is upon us. Optionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure,  it is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we  work – remotely, in office or hybrid. In the area of talent, it  is about building and deploying agile learning platforms  so that our people can hone their skill sets to match  new demand and new technologies. It is about having a  digital-first and AI-first business architecture which can  be constantly configured. It is finding the right balance  between retaining the core of a company and working  with partners on others. Optionality must be ingrained in  strategy and execution. Our CEO, Salil Parekh, and his global leadership team,  realized early on the value that advanced digital  technologies like AI and cloud, and more recently,  generative AI, can bring to imagine and execute for  multiple options in the future. They came together as  One Infosys to orchestrate teams that lead the charge to  continually transform Infosys into an organization that truly  realizes human-machine synergies, from fundamentally  rethinking organizational design to segmenting cognitive  tasks to get the right balance between people, technology,  and process. Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards  a future where we don't just solve immediate business\nproblems, but continually innovate and architect for  challenges that may emerge in the future. We build it  for ourselves first, and then, deeply rooted in our own  experience, take it widely to our clients.  The awesome possibilities of generative AI, we know from  our own journey to becoming an AI-first enterprise, is not  without its risks. The problems of AI hallucination, systemic  biases, lack of explainability along with plenty of practical,  ethical and intellectual property-related issues remain open  and up for debate. We also know, from our experience,  that the path to scaling AI enterprise-wide is non-linear.  Often, organizations, seeking to mine value from data and  AI models, successfully undertake pilots but fail to factor in  what it will take to scale value across the whole enterprise.  As demands increase, data volumes grow, and complexity  rises, companies find themselves unable to surmount the  associated challenges and start to question the path to  value. Navigating to value-at-scale from AI and retaining  the larger strategic vision while breaking down the tasks  into sequential small wins, is not always intuitive or simple.  With our AI-first strategy, Infosys is guided by that road  map. We are also bringing to our global clients the ability  to accelerate business value and amplify human potential  using AI technologies with Infosys TopazTM. The digital transformation of every industry and every  business, over the last several years, has laid the foundation  to create optionality as we navigate the way forward.  Our clients have always trusted us to assist them not only  to make the right digital investments but to safeguard  these investments for their future. Today, we are excited  by the opportunity and humbled by the responsibility we  have to enable them to bring all their digital capabilities  together to execute quickly and effectively for now, while  developing multiple options to amplify their competitive  advantage and market leadership in an uncertain future.  Our client relevance has never been so compelling, our  investment in employees as continuous and consistent,  and our purpose so keen. We are ready to co-create with  our clients and our entire ecosystem a flexible future that  puts people first and benefits the broader society even as  it propels business forward. After all, like many have said,  imagination is our invisible power to create all things. Our  future can be as bright as we imagine it to be. Nandan M.
