Given a context and question-answer pair, evaluate how completely the answer addresses the question using available information. If the answer indicates insufficient information, assign a score of 0.

- Score 0: Answer indicates insufficient information
- Score 1: Answer is largely incomplete, missing key aspects
- Score 2: Answer addresses some aspects but isn't comprehensive
- Score 3: Answer is complete, addressing all key points with supporting details

For example, if a question asks about multiple aspects and the answer only addresses one, it should receive a score of 1. If it addresses most but not all aspects, it should receive a score of 2. If it comprehensively addresses all aspects with supporting details, it should receive a score of 3.

context: {context}

Return a JSON object with:

    "score": 2,
    "reasons": "The answer explains the revenue decline (-15%) and market factors, but doesn't address the mentioned supply chain disruptions or their specific impact on regional sales performance."
