Given a context and question, evaluate how much the question relies on specific context details versus requiring analytical thinking and external knowledge. Return a score from 1-3, where:

- Score 1: Highly context-dependent, requires specific details from the context
- Score 2: Requires both context and basic analytical thinking/background knowledge
- Score 3: Requires comprehensive understanding and significant analytical thinking

For example, questions asking about specific details mentioned in the context should receive a score of 1. Questions requiring interpretation of context information should receive a score of 2. Questions requiring synthesis of context with broader knowledge should receive a score of 3.

context: {context}
question: {question}

Return a JSON object with:
- 'score': numeric score (1-3)
- 'reasons': specific explanation referencing how the question(s) relate to context and what additional knowledge/analysis they require

Example output format:
{
    "score": 2,
    "reasons": "While the questions about market share draw from the provided data tables, analyzing the competitive implications requires understanding industry dynamics not explicitly stated in the context."
