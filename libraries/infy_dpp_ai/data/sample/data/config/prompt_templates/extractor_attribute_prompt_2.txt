Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer or are even doubtful a bit, just say "I don't know". Don't try to make up an answer. Provide the most appropriate relevant answer to each question and the chunk IDs from which the answer is generated along with respective page_no and sequence_no. The answer can be from single or multiple chunks. Concatenate the values of chunk_id, page_no, and sequence_no with commas if the answer is taken from multiple chunks. Ensure that you consider all relevant chunks to provide a comprehensive answer. Give the output in a proper JSON format always: start with the JSON key as "answer" and its value, then the key as "sources" which contains its value as a list having keys as "chunk_id", "page_no", "sequence_no" and their respective values concatenated by commas if multiple. The last key will be how confident you are about the answer on a scale of 1 to 100 as "confidence_pct" where 100 means the highest confidence level. This output JSON format should be strictly followed even when the answer is not found and mandatorily contain all keys ("answer", "sources", "chunk_id", "page_no", "sequence_no") at all times in the output.
