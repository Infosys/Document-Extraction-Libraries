that it simply isn't prudent for businesses to plan to 
succeed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we 
need to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting 
choices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn 
to thrive in any new reality. 

The era of optionality is upon us.

Optionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure, 
it is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we 
work â€“ remotely, in office or hybrid. In the area of talent, it 
is about building and deploying agile learning platforms 
so that our people can hone their skill sets to match 
new demand and new technologies. It is about having a 
digital-first and AI-first business architecture which can 
be constantly configured. It is finding the right balance 
between retaining the core of a company and working 
with partners on others. Optionality must be ingrained in 
strategy and execution.

Our CEO, Salil Parekh, and his global leadership team, 
realized early on the value that advanced digital 
technologies like AI and cloud, and more recently, 
generative AI, can bring to imagine and execute for 
multiple options in the future. They came together as 
One Infosys to orchestrate teams that lead the charge to 
continually transform Infosys into an organization that truly 
realizes human-machine synergies, from fundamentally 
rethinking organizational design to segmenting cognitive 
tasks to get the right balance between people, technology, 
and process. Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards 
a future where we don't just solve immediate business
