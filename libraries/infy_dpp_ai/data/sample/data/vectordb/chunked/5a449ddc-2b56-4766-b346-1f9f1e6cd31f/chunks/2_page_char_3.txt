Optionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure, 
it is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we 
work â€“ remotely, in office or hybrid. In the area of talent, it 
is about building and deploying agile learning platforms 
so that our people can hone their skill sets to match 
new demand and new technologies. It is about having a 
digital-first and AI-first business architecture which can 
be constantly configured. It is finding the right balance 
between retaining the core of a company and working 
with partners on others. Optionality must be ingrained in 
strategy and execution.
