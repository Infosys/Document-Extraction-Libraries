pressure, and crunched resources require that companies


must become better, more efficient in their ability to be


resilient in the present while also securing their future


growth. This is easier said than done. The extreme volatility


that surrounds us creates so many probable future states,


that it simply isn't prudent for businesses to plan to 
succeed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we 
need to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting 
choices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn 
to thrive in any new reality. 

The era of optionality is upon us.
