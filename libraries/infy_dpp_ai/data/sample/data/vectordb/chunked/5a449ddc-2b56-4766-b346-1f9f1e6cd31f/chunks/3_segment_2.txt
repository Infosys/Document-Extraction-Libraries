Our learning ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning 
days for our employees during the year. 

Last year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders â€“ 

US$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our 
share buyback program.

At the end of the financial year, we were the leading 
company among our peers in total shareholder return over 
the past five years.

We remain committed to the communities we live and 
operate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we 
support a variety of social causes, including creating 
positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and 
women empowerment. Our Infosys Springboard initiative 
continues to help build digital skills by providing free 
learning programs to millions of people around the world.

In the past few quarters, we have seen the global 
economy dealing with inflation, interest rate increases, 

and changes in demand environment for companies in 
various industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in 
automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have 
held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in 
the evolving economic environment.

As I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the 
dedication of our employees, the strength of our 
capabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance 
of our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our 
clients and continue to create impact for them.

With my warmest regards,
