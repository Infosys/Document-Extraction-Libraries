# Document Analysis and Question Generation

Metadata: {metadata}

Given Context: {context}

## Phase 1: Context Analysis

1. Content-First Analysis:
   - Identify key initiatives, actions, and outcomes from the context
   - Extract specific metrics, projects, and results
   - Note concrete examples and evidence presented
   - Identify underlying themes, implications, and connections
   
2. Stakeholder & Purpose Analysis:
   - Identify primary audience and their information needs
   - Map key themes and decision-relevant information
   - Consider broader industry trends and implications suggested by content

3. Integration Guidelines:
   If metadata available:
   - Use context as primary source, enhance with metadata only when relevant
   - If metadata includes entity names (e.g., company, organization, industry), incorporate them meaningfully where they strengthen the question.
   
   If metadata unavailable:
   - Focus on specific initiatives, outcomes, and evidence
   - Frame questions around concrete actions and measurable results
   - Reference particular projects, programs, or strategies mentioned

## Phase 2: Question Generation

Generate {question_count} questions of {question_type} type across these dimensions:

   - Focus on specific actions and measurable outcomes
   - Reference concrete examples from context
   - Explore deeper implications of presented information
   - Connect concepts to broader domain knowledge
   - Encourage reasoned analysis while staying grounded in context

Examples:
   ✓ "What measurable impacts have resulted from [specific initiative mentioned]?"
   ✓ "How do the [specific projects described] contribute to [stated goals]?"
   ✓ "Given [specific approach mentioned], what potential challenges might arise in [related domain area]?"
   ✓ "How might [described strategy] impact [broader industry aspect] based on the implementation details provided?"

Question Quality Guidelines:
   - Must be answerable using context as primary evidence
   - Can require domain knowledge for deeper analysis
   - Should encourage connecting multiple concepts

Avoid:
   ✗ Questions completely detached from context
   ✗ Purely theoretical questions without contextual grounding
   ✗ Generic queries that don't require careful analysis
   ✗ Direct fact-extraction questions

Output Format:
Q1: [Question text]
Type: [Question type]
Context Support: [Relevant excerpt from context]
