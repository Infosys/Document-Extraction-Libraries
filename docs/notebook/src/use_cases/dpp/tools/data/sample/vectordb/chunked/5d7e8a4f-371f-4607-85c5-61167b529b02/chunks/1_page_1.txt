Strategy


Our clients and prospective clients are faced with


transformative business opportunities due to advances in


software and computing technology. These organizations


are dealing with the challenge of having to reinvent 
their core offerings, processes and systems rapidly and 
position themselves as 'digitally enabled'. The journey to 
the digital future requires not just an understanding of 
new technologies and new ways of working, but a deep 
appreciation of existing technology landscapes, business 
processes and practices. Our strategy is to be a navigator 
for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute their 
journey to a digital future.
We have embraced a four-pronged strategy to strengthen 
our relevance with clients and drive accelerated 
value creation:


Energize the core
We believe the investments we have made, and continue 
to make, in our strategy will enable us to advise and help 
our clients as they tackle the current market conditions. 
Further, we have been able to successfully enable most of 
our employees worldwide to work remotely and securely 
– giving us the operational stability to deliver on client 
commitments and ensuring our own business continuity.
Over the last four years, we have executed this strategy 
and generated significant outcomes.


Scale agile digital
Our revenue from digital technology-related services 
and solutions has more than doubled in the last three 
years, and currently comprises 57% of our total revenue. 
We are rated as a leader in 54 industry analyst ratings 
across our digital offerings. These outcomes are a result 
of investments we have made to expand our digital 
footprint via reskilling of our employees, targeted 
acquisitions, strong ecosystem partnerships, innovation 
experience centers across the world, intellectual property 
development, reconfiguring our workspaces for agile 
software development and enhancing our brand.


Scale agile digital


Reskill our people


Expand localization


Our human experience-related services expanded with


the opening of eight innovation hubs, six digital studios,


12 proximity centers and 20 living labs around the world.


During the fiscal, we entered into a definitive agreement


to acquire oddity to augment our human experience 
capabilities in Europe. Through our academia partnerships 
with Purdue, Trinity, RISD and eCornell, we have trained 
over 4,500 employees in niche digital skills.
Our Insight and data analytics services and solutions 
were further strengthened with the launch of our Infosys 
Applied AI solutions, coupled with the Infosys Data 
Workbench. Our AI platform, Infosys Applied AI, helps 
enterprises adopt a comprehensive approach and roadmap 
to scaling enterprise-grade AI for their businesses. 
With advances in next-generation computing power, ready 
access to datasets on the cloud to train Machine Learning 
models and consumable Artificial Intelligence (AI) services, 
our solutions enable our clients to generate insights from 
their data and open opportunities for data monetization.
Our Innovate-related services and solutions are boosted 
by workspaces that have been specifically redesigned 
for agile software development, teams reskilled in agile 
methodologies, certified scrum masters and capabilities 
in horizontal technologies such as 5G, autonomous tech, 
product engineering, internet of things and blockchain.
Our Accelerate-related services are aimed at rapidly 
transforming our clients' legacy technology landscapes 
and processes with digital technology. We invested in, and 
built strong partnerships with cloud hyperscalers such as 
AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure, and SaaS providers. 
In fiscal 2022, we expanded our integrated cloud offering 
Infosys Cobalt™, which now offers over 35,000 cloud 
assets and over 300 industry cloud solution blueprints. 
Infosys Cobalt™ is helping enterprises to securely access 
cloud capabilities with the assurance of single-point 
accountability for outcomes.
We launched Infosys Equinox, our flagship digital 
commerce platform, which is a set of core microservices 
encompassing all digital commerce scenarios to help 
enterprises rapidly build and deploy features across all 
touchpoints and channels, without the friction associated 
with legacy platforms.
Our Automation and AI services grew on the back of our 
alliances with leading Robotic Process Automation (RPA) 
solution providers and niche AI players, powered by our


Strategy


best-in-class solutions, IPs and frameworks. We have


automated over 20,000+ processes for our clients and have


over 1,000 ready use cases across industries.


Our Assure services, in software testing and cybersecurity,


continued to grow with investments in Cyber Gaze, our 
cybersecurity dashboard and suite of related applications.


Energize the core
Leveraging automation and AI, we are winning and 
executing several engagements for our clients to 
modernize their core legacy technology and process 
landscapes. We made significant investments in our 
Live Enterprise platform, including our Bot Factory of 
preconfigured automation bots and LEAP, our platform 
for optimizing large-scale application maintenance and 
reengineering. In fiscal 2022, we won a total contract 
value of over US$ 9.5 billion in large deals, continuing 
to demonstrate our capabilities and competitiveness in 
executing complex transformation programs. In addition, 
investments in our own internal systems, reimagination 
of our internal processes and automation of software 
development processes have helped increase our agility, 
boost productivity and enhance our competitiveness even 
in the current paradigm of remote working.


Reskill our people
Continuous learning and reskilling have always 
been integral to our operating model. We operate 
our reskilling program with the twin objectives of 
increasing fulfillment of demand for digital skills in 
client projects and for enriching the expertise of our 
global workforce in next-generation technologies and 
methodologies. We invested in, and scaled, our digital 
reskilling program globally. Lex, our in-house-developed, 
anytime-anywhere-learning platform, offers over 
13,700 courses curated for easy consumption on mobile 
devices with advanced telemetry, gamification and 
certification features. Over 2,99,000 of our employees use 
Lex and are spending approximately 2.3 million training 
days compared to 1.9 million in the last fiscal with close to 
45 minutes per day on average for learning activities.

value


With the objective of creating differentiated talent pools


in our markets, we made significant investments in 
expanding our local workforce in the US, the UK, Europe, 
Japan, China and Australia. We established innovation 
hubs, nearshore centers and digital design studios across 
geographies. Further, we expanded our university and 
community college partnerships in all these regions to 
aid internships, recruitment, training and joint research. 
In fiscal 2022, we recruited over 14,805 employees locally 
in our markets, of which 3,650 were fresh graduates. 
This initiative also significantly de-risks our operations from 
regulatory changes related to immigration policies.
Looking ahead, and to continue staying relevant to the 
emerging needs of our clients, our strategic areas of focus 
for the next few years will be to further:
• Scale our cloud capabilities, especially around cloud 
advisory, data on cloud, cloud security, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS 
and private cloud;
• Expand capabilities in key digital technology areas 
such as AI, product engineering, cybersecurity and 
human experience;
• Strengthen our employee value proposition for the 
newer contexts of work and workplace;
• Run our operations in a cost-effective and agile manner, 
including increasing the levels of automation in our 
service delivery;
• Deliver on our ESG commitments, while at the 
same time enabling our clients to realize their 
sustainability goals.
