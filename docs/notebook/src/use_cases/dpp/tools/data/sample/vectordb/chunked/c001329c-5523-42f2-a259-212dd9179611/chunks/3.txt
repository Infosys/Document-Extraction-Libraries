Letter to the Shareholder Dear shareholder, Financial year 2023 was a strong year for our business. In FY23, we saw growth of over 15%, operating margins  of 21%, and free cash flow of US$2.5 billion. Our attrition  reduced for each quarter of the year. With the changing economic environment, we positioned  our Company to work with clients for their digital  transformation as well as their cost efficiency and  automation programs, enabling us to support them in two  critical areas of interest. We have developed a strong set of capabilities in  generative artificial intelligence to enhance how we enable  our clients to derive value. These capabilities are available  to all our clients in the form of Infosys TopazTM. Our Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate  with our clients. Our platforms, including Finacle for banks,  McCamish for insurance, Equinox for commerce, and Helix  for healthcare, are creating strong impact with clients.  During the year, we were recognized by Brand Finance  among the top three most valuable IT services brands  globally. We continue to deepen our engagement with our clients.  The number of clients with over US$100 million in revenue  for the year was at 40. The number of clients with over  US$50 million in revenue for the year was at 75. Our large  deal intensity was strong during the year. We had 95 large  deals with a value of US$9.8 billion in the year. We see  our One Infosys approach helping support our clients by  bringing all our capabilities and the strength of our entire  employee-base to work for their benefit. We recruited over 50,000 college graduates in the year and  ended the year with over 3,40,000 employees. At the end  of the year, 39% of our employees were women.
Our learning ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning  days for our employees during the year.  Last year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders â€“  US$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our  share buyback program. At the end of the financial year, we were the leading  company among our peers in total shareholder return over  the past five years. We remain committed to the communities we live and  operate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we  support a variety of social causes, including creating  positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and  women empowerment. Our Infosys Springboard initiative  continues to help build digital skills by providing free  learning programs to millions of people around the world. In the past few quarters, we have seen the global  economy dealing with inflation, interest rate increases,  and changes in demand environment for companies in  various industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in  automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have  held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in  the evolving economic environment. As I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the  dedication of our employees, the strength of our  capabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance  of our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our  clients and continue to create impact for them. With my warmest regards,
Bengaluru May 29, 2023
