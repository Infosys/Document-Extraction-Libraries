These organizations  are dealing with the challenge of having to reinvent  their core offerings, processes and systems rapidly and  position themselves as 'digitally enabled'. The journey to  the digital future requires not just an understanding of  new technologies and new ways of working, but a deep  appreciation of existing technology landscapes, business  processes and practices. Our strategy is to be a navigator  for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute their  journey to a digital future. We have embraced a four-pronged strategy to strengthen  our relevance with clients and drive accelerated  value creation:\nEnergize the core We believe the investments we have made, and continue  to make, in our strategy will enable us to advise and help  our clients as they tackle the current market conditions.  Further, we have been able to successfully enable most of  our employees worldwide to work remotely and securely  \u2013 giving us the operational stability to deliver on client  commitments and ensuring our own business continuity. Over the last four years, we have executed this strategy  and generated significant outcomes.\nScale agile digital Our revenue from digital technology-related services  and solutions has more than doubled in the last three  years, and currently comprises 57% of our total revenue.  We are rated as a leader in 54 industry analyst ratings  across our digital offerings. These outcomes are a result  of investments we have made to expand our digital  footprint via reskilling of our employees, targeted  acquisitions, strong ecosystem partnerships, innovation  experience centers across the world, intellectual property  development, reconfiguring our workspaces for agile  software development and enhancing our brand.\nScale agile digital\nReskill our people\nExpand localization\nOur human experience-related services expanded with  the opening of eight innovation hubs, six digital studios,  12 proximity centers and 20 living labs around the world.  During the fiscal, we entered into a definitive agreement  to acquire oddity to augment our human experience  capabilities in Europe. Through our academia partnerships  with Purdue, Trinity, RISD and eCornell, we have trained  over 4,500 employees in niche digital skills. Our Insight and data analytics services and solutions  were further strengthened with the launch of our Infosys  Applied AI solutions, coupled with the Infosys Data  Workbench. Our AI platform, Infosys Applied AI, helps  enterprises adopt a comprehensive approach and roadmap  to scaling enterprise-grade AI for their businesses.  With advances in next-generation computing power, ready  access to datasets on the cloud to train Machine Learning  models and consumable Artificial Intelligence (AI) services,  our solutions enable our clients to generate insights from  their data and open opportunities for data monetization. Our Innovate-related services and solutions are boosted  by workspaces that have been specifically redesigned  for agile software development, teams reskilled in agile  methodologies, certified scrum masters and capabilities  in horizontal technologies such as 5G, autonomous tech,  product engineering, internet of things and blockchain. Our Accelerate-related services are aimed at rapidly  transforming our clients\u2019 legacy technology landscapes  and processes with digital technology. We invested in, and  built strong partnerships with cloud hyperscalers such as  AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure, and SaaS providers.  In fiscal 2022, we expanded our integrated cloud offering  Infosys Cobalt\u2122, which now offers over 35,000 cloud  assets and over 300 industry cloud solution blueprints.  Infosys Cobalt\u2122 is helping enterprises to securely access  cloud capabilities with the assurance of single-point  accountability for outcomes. We launched Infosys Equinox, our flagship digital  commerce platform, which is a set of core microservices  encompassing all digital commerce scenarios to help  enterprises rapidly build and deploy features across all  touchpoints and channels, without the friction associated  with legacy platforms. Our Automation and AI services grew on the back of our  alliances with leading Robotic Process Automation (RPA)  solution providers and niche AI players, powered by our\nStrategy\nbest-in-class solutions, IPs and frameworks. We have  automated over 20,000+ processes for our clients and have  over 1,000 ready use cases across industries. Our Assure services, in software testing and cybersecurity,  continued to grow with investments in Cyber Gaze, our  cybersecurity dashboard and suite of related applications.\nEnergize the core Leveraging automation and AI, we are winning and  executing several engagements for our clients to  modernize their core legacy technology and process  landscapes. We made significant investments in our  Live Enterprise platform, including our Bot Factory of  preconfigured automation bots and LEAP, our platform  for optimizing large-scale application maintenance and  reengineering. In fiscal 2022, we won a total contract  value of over US$ 9.5 billion in large deals, continuing  to demonstrate our capabilities and competitiveness in  executing complex transformation programs. In addition,  investments in our own internal systems, reimagination  of our internal processes and automation of software  development processes have helped increase our agility,  boost productivity and enhance our competitiveness even  in the current paradigm of remote working.\nReskill our people Continuous learning and reskilling have always  been integral to our operating model. We operate  our reskilling program with the twin objectives of  increasing fulfillment of demand for digital skills in  client projects and for enriching the expertise of our  global workforce in next-generation technologies and  methodologies. We invested in, and scaled, our digital  reskilling program globally. Lex, our in-house-developed,  anytime-anywhere-learning platform, offers over  13,700\u00a0courses curated for easy consumption on mobile  devices with advanced telemetry, gamification and  certification features. Over 2,99,000 of our employees use  Lex and are spending approximately 2.3 million training  days compared to 1.9 million in the last fiscal with close to  45 minutes per day on average for learning activities.\nExpand localization With the objective of creating differentiated talent pools  in our markets, we made significant investments in  expanding our local workforce in the US, the UK, Europe,  Japan, China and Australia. We established innovation  hubs, nearshore centers and digital design studios across  geographies. Further, we expanded our university and  community college partnerships in all these regions to  aid internships, recruitment, training and joint research.  In fiscal 2022, we recruited over 14,805 employees locally  in our markets, of which 3,650 were fresh graduates.  This\u00a0initiative also significantly de-risks our operations from  regulatory changes related to immigration policies. Looking ahead, and to continue staying relevant to the  emerging needs of our clients, our strategic areas of focus  for the next few years will be to further: \u2022 Scale our cloud capabilities, especially around cloud  advisory, data on cloud, cloud security, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS  and private cloud; \u2022 Expand capabilities in key digital technology areas  such as AI, product engineering, cybersecurity and  human experience; \u2022 Strengthen our employee value proposition for the  newer contexts of work and workplace; \u2022 Run our operations in a cost-effective and agile manner,  including increasing the levels of automation in our  service delivery; \u2022 Deliver on our ESG commitments, while at the  same time enabling our clients to realize their  sustainability goals.\n[{\"\": null, \"null\": \"\"}]", "metadata": {"source": "/data/vectordb/chunked/1c8e1d10-3258-42f1-801d-59e54456ae18/chunks/1.txt", "chunk_id": "c4e5e", "page_no": 1, "sequence_no": 1, "bbox_format": "X1,Y1,X2,Y2", "bbox": [189.0, 385.0, 4920.0, 2929.0], "doc_name": "AR_2021-22_page-20-21.pdf", "document_id": "1c8e1d10-3258-42f1-801d-59e54456ae18"}}, "c7b2598b-2077-4c02-8e34-80256c5843ad": {"content": "Business highlights\nDifferentiated cloud services and large deal momentum drive Infosys\u2019 highest annual   growth in a decade.

The placid  and the predictable are behind us as each new day brings  new inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted  models we have constructed of the world around us. The  cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand  volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency  to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without  warning, is what\u2019s before us. In any week, we may oscillate  from caution to optimism and back to caution based on  the news of the\u00a0day.  Such times of intense uncertainty, great short-term  pressure, and crunched resources require that companies  must become better, more efficient in their ability to be  resilient in the present while also securing their future  growth. This is easier said than done. The extreme volatility  that surrounds us creates so many probable future states,  that it simply isn\u2019t prudent for businesses to plan to  succeed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we  need to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting  choices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn  to thrive in any new reality.  The era of optionality is upon us. Optionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure,  it is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we  work \u2013 remotely, in office or hybrid. In the area of talent, it  is about building and deploying agile learning platforms  so that our people can hone their skill sets to match  new demand and new technologies. It is about having a  digital-first and AI-first business architecture which can  be constantly configured. It is finding the right balance  between retaining the core of a company and working  with partners on others. Optionality must be ingrained in  strategy and execution. Our CEO, Salil Parekh, and his global leadership team,  realized early on the value that advanced digital  technologies like AI and cloud, and more recently,  generative AI, can bring to imagine and execute for  multiple options in the future. They came together as  One Infosys to orchestrate teams that lead the charge to  continually transform Infosys into an organization that truly  realizes human-machine synergies, from fundamentally  rethinking organizational design to segmenting cognitive  tasks to get the right balance between people, technology,  and process. Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards  a future where we don\u2019t just solve immediate business\nproblems, but continually innovate and architect for  challenges that may emerge in the future. We build it  for ourselves first, and then, deeply rooted in our own  experience, take it widely to our clients.  The awesome possibilities of generative AI, we know from  our own journey to becoming an AI-first enterprise, is not  without its risks. The problems of AI hallucination, systemic  biases, lack of explainability along with plenty of practical,  ethical and intellectual property-related issues remain open  and up for debate. We also know, from our experience,  that the path to scaling AI enterprise-wide is non-linear.  Often, organizations, seeking to mine value from data and  AI models, successfully undertake pilots but fail to factor in  what it will take to scale value across the whole enterprise.  As demands increase, data volumes grow, and complexity  rises, companies find themselves unable to surmount the  associated challenges and start to question the path to  value. Navigating to value-at-scale from AI and retaining  the larger strategic vision while breaking down the tasks  into sequential small wins, is not always intuitive or simple.  With our AI-first strategy, Infosys is guided by that road  map. We are also bringing to our global clients the ability  to accelerate business value and amplify human potential  using AI technologies with Infosys TopazTM. The digital transformation of every industry and every  business, over the last several years, has laid the foundation  to create optionality as we navigate the way forward.  Our clients have always trusted us to assist them not only  to make the right digital investments but to safeguard  these investments for their future. Today, we are excited  by the opportunity and humbled by the responsibility we  have to enable them to bring all their digital capabilities  together to execute quickly and effectively for now, while  developing multiple options to amplify their competitive  advantage and market leadership in an uncertain future.  Our client relevance has never been so compelling, our  investment in employees as continuous and consistent,  and our purpose so keen. We are ready to co-create with  our clients and our entire ecosystem a flexible future that  puts people first and benefits the broader society even as  it propels business forward. After all, like many have said,  imagination is our invisible power to create all things. Our  future can be as bright as we imagine it to be. Nandan M.

In FY23, we saw growth of over 15%, operating margins  of 21%, and free cash flow of US$2.5 billion. Our attrition  reduced for each quarter of the year. With the changing economic environment, we positioned  our Company to work with clients for their digital  transformation as well as their cost efficiency and  automation programs, enabling us to support them in two  critical areas of interest. We have developed a strong set of capabilities in  generative artificial intelligence to enhance how we enable  our clients to derive value. These capabilities are available  to all our clients in the form of Infosys TopazTM. Our Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate  with our clients. Our platforms, including Finacle for banks,  McCamish for insurance, Equinox for commerce, and Helix  for healthcare, are creating strong impact with clients.  During the year, we were recognized by Brand Finance  among the top three most valuable IT services brands  globally. We continue to deepen our engagement with our clients.  The number of clients with over US$100 million in revenue  for the year was at 40. The number of clients with over  US$50 million in revenue for the year was at 75. Our large  deal intensity was strong during the year. We had 95 large  deals with a value of US$9.8 billion in the year. We see  our One Infosys approach helping support our clients by  bringing all our capabilities and the strength of our entire  employee-base to work for their benefit. We recruited over 50,000 college graduates in the year and  ended the year with over 3,40,000 employees. At the end  of the year, 39% of our employees were women.\nOur learning ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning  days for our employees during the year.  Last year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders \u2013  US$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our  share buyback program. At the end of the financial year, we were the leading  company among our peers in total shareholder return over  the past five years. We remain committed to the communities we live and  operate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we  support a variety of social causes, including creating  positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and  women empowerment. Our Infosys Springboard initiative  continues to help build digital skills by providing free  learning programs to millions of people around the world. In the past few quarters, we have seen the global  economy dealing with inflation, interest rate increases,  and changes in demand environment for companies in  various industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in  automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have  held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in  the evolving economic environment. As I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the  dedication of our employees, the strength of our  capabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance  of our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our  clients and continue to create impact for them.
