Analysis of Employee Wellness Programs


The Employee Health Metrics table reveals a correlation between
participation in wellness programs and self-reported health status.
Employees who actively participate in wellness initiatives, such as Rachel
Green and Jessica Smith, tend to report better health outcomes and higher
physical activity levels. This suggests that the wellness programs are effective
in promoting healthier lifestyles among employees.
