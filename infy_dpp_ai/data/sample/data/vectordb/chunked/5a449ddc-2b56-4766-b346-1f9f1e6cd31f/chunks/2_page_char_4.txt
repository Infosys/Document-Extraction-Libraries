Our CEO, Salil Parekh, and his global leadership team, 
realized early on the value that advanced digital 
technologies like AI and cloud, and more recently, 
generative AI, can bring to imagine and execute for 
multiple options in the future. They came together as 
One Infosys to orchestrate teams that lead the charge to 
continually transform Infosys into an organization that truly 
realizes human-machine synergies, from fundamentally 
rethinking organizational design to segmenting cognitive 
tasks to get the right balance between people, technology, 
and process. Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards 
a future where we don't just solve immediate business


problems, but continually innovate and architect for


challenges that may emerge in the future. We build it
