associated challenges and start to question the path to 
value. Navigating to value-at-scale from AI and retaining 
the larger strategic vision while breaking down the tasks 
into sequential small wins, is not always intuitive or simple. 

With our AI-first strategy, Infosys is guided by that road 
map. We are also bringing to our global clients the ability 
to accelerate business value and amplify human potential 
using AI technologies with Infosys TopazTM.

The digital transformation of every industry and every 
business, over the last several years, has laid the foundation 
to create optionality as we navigate the way forward. 

Our clients have always trusted us to assist them not only 
to make the right digital investments but to safeguard 
these investments for their future. Today, we are excited 
by the opportunity and humbled by the responsibility we 
have to enable them to bring all their digital capabilities 
together to execute quickly and effectively for now, while 
developing multiple options to amplify their competitive 
advantage and market leadership in an uncertain future. 

Our client relevance has never been so compelling, our 
investment in employees as continuous and consistent, 

and our purpose so keen. We are ready to co-create with 
our clients and our entire ecosystem a flexible future that 
puts people first and benefits the broader society even as 
it propels business forward. After all, like many have said, 

imagination is our invisible power to create all things. Our 
future can be as bright as we imagine it to be.
