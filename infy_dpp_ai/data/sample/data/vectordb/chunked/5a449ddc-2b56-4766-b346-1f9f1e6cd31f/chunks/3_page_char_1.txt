Performance overview
Letter to the Shareholder

Dear shareholder,

Financial year 2023 was a strong year for our business.

In FY23, we saw growth of over 15%, operating margins 
of 21%, and free cash flow of US$2.5 billion. Our attrition 
reduced for each quarter of the year.

With the changing economic environment, we positioned 
our Company to work with clients for their digital 
transformation as well as their cost efficiency and 
automation programs, enabling us to support them in two 
critical areas of interest.

We have developed a strong set of capabilities in 
generative artificial intelligence to enhance how we enable 
our clients to derive value. These capabilities are available 
to all our clients in the form of Infosys TopazTM.
