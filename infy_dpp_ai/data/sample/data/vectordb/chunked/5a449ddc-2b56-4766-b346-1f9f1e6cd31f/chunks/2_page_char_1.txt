Chairman's message


Navigating uncertainty


If there is one overriding theme that defines our current


world, it is that it is suffused with uncertainty. The placid


and the predictable are behind us as each new day brings


new inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted


models we have constructed of the world around us. The


cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand


volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency


to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without
