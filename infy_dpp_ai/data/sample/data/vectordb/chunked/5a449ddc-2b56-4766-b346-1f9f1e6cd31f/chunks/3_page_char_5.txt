and changes in demand environment for companies in 
various industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in 
automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have 
held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in 
the evolving economic environment.

As I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the 
dedication of our employees, the strength of our 
capabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance 
of our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our 
clients and continue to create impact for them.

With my warmest regards,
