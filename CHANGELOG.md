  * `infy_db_service`: There are two ways to store the indexes created, one is locally in the environment where this pipeline is running, and the other one is using infy_db_service which provides way to store indexes in a central environment where this service is hosted.
  * `infy_search_service`: If infy_db_service is used to store created indexes then use infy_search_service to query on those documents.

## V 3.5.1
- Bug fix for kernel issue.
- Ability to filter response based on document name during QnA.
- Vectordb file type changed.
- Support for chat models gpt-4 and gpt-4-32k.

## V 3.5.0
- Ability to extract images from native pdf and do OCR to get any text within it. (The libraries modified - InfyFormatConverterJAR, infy_common_utils, infy_dpp_content_extractor, infy_dpp_segmentation)
- Modified pipeline card to visualize the pipeline.
- Bug fix.

## V 3.4.0
- The default OCR tool used in all notebooks is InfyOcrEngine (Tess4J - tesseract)
- Segmentation processor logic revamped into separate processor based on specific feature.
  - `segment_parser` processor deprecated.
  - `segment_generator` processor modified, now takes care of detecting segment using techniques (e.g., ocr, native_pdf, txt, json, detectron)
- Below are new processors in infy_dpp_segmentation library:
    - `segment_classifier` classifies segment as header & footer (e.g., segments near to page edges controlled by threshold value)
    - `segment_consolidator`takes best of all techniques (e.g., union of bboxes from different techniques)      
    - `page_column_detector`:
      - Auto-detection of columns in a page based on segments already detected.
      - It can also remove header and footers segments from the already detected segments if mentioned in configuration, under exclude parameter section.
    - `segment_merger` merges smaller segments to create larger segments (e.g., lines to paragraphs).
        
    - `segment_sequencer` gives sequence number to all segments based on some params (e.g., sequencing to form a reading order for LLM)
- Debug feature added to all segmentation related processor, which can plot processor's output on images.
- For `single column` document below processors are optional. For `multi-column` document segmentation all six processors of infy_dpp_segmentation is mandatory to be used in pipeline.
