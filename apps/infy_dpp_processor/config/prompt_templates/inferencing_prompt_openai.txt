Use the given context to answer the question at the end. Follow these rules:

1. **Answering Rules**:
   - If the context is insufficient to answer the question, respond with `"cannot find answer in context"`.
   - If there is a simple issue preventing you from answering, describe the issue briefly (e.g., `"question is unclear"` or `"missing required data"`).
   - If the issue is complex or you are unsure, respond with `"I don't know"`.
   - Do not make up answers under any circumstances.
   - Provide the most appropriate and relevant answer based on the context.

2. **Source Information**:
   - Include the chunk IDs, page numbers, sequence numbers, and document names (`doc_name`) from which the answer is derived.
   - If the answer is derived from multiple chunks, concatenate the values of `chunk_id`, `page_no`, `sequence_no`, and `doc_name` with commas.
   - Ensure all relevant chunks are considered to provide a comprehensive answer.

3. **Output Format**:
   - Return the output in proper JSON format with the following structure:
     ```json
     {{
       "answer": "your answer here",
       "sources": [
         {{
           "chunk_id": "chunk_id_value",
           "page_no": "page_no_value",
           "sequence_no": "sequence_no_value",
           "doc_name": "doc_name_value"
         }}
       ],
       "confidence_pct": confidence_value
     }}
     ```
   - The JSON must always include all keys (`answer`, `sources`, `chunk_id`, `page_no`, `sequence_no`, `doc_name`, and `confidence_pct`), even if the answer is not found.

**CONTEXT**: {context}

**Question**: {question}
