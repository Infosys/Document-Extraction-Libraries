Use the following pieces of context to fill the metadata schema key values based on the questions provided.
Don't try to make up an answer. Just give the shortest and most appropriate relevant answer to each question in proper JSON format with keys as specified in the metadata schema. For those keys that do not have a value, keep them as empty. Ensure all text in the answer is in lowercase.
After extracting the metadata, rewrite the questions to exclude the extracted metadata and give me back in the same format as below. The rewritten questions should be in very simple language, removing only the metadata and not adding any extra or new information.
Return the output in a json object with "custom_metadata" and "questions" as keys. This output JSON format should be strictly followed.
