{"text": "Performance overview\nChairman's message\nNavigating uncertainty\nIf there is one overriding theme that defines our current \nworld, it is that it is suffused with uncertainty. The placid \nand the predictable are behind us as each new day brings \nnew inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted \nmodels we have constructed of the world around us. The \ncocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand \nvolatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency \nto resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without \nwarning, is what's before us. In any week, we may oscillate \nfrom caution to optimism and back to caution based on \nthe news of the\u00a0day. \nSuch times of intense uncertainty, great short-term \npressure, and crunched resources require that companies \nmust become better, more efficient in their ability to be \nresilient in the present while also securing their future \ngrowth. This is easier said than done. The extreme volatility \nthat surrounds us creates so many probable future states, \nthat it simply isn't prudent for businesses to plan to \nsucceed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we \nneed to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting \nchoices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn \nto thrive in any new reality. \nThe era of optionality is upon us.\nOptionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure, \nit is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we \nwork \u2013 remotely, in office or hybrid. In the area of talent, it \nis about building and deploying agile learning platforms \nso that our people can hone their skill sets to match \nnew demand and new technologies. It is about having a \ndigital-first and AI-first business architecture which can \nbe constantly configured. It is finding the right balance \nbetween retaining the core of a company and working \nwith partners on others. Optionality must be ingrained in \nstrategy and execution.\nOur CEO, Salil Parekh, and his global leadership team, \nrealized early on the value that advanced digital \ntechnologies like AI and cloud, and more recently, \ngenerative AI, can bring to imagine and execute for \nmultiple options in the future. They came together as \nOne Infosys to orchestrate teams that lead the charge to \ncontinually transform Infosys into an organization that truly \nrealizes human-machine synergies, from fundamentally \nrethinking organizational design to segmenting cognitive \ntasks to get the right balance between people, technology, \nand process. Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards \na future where we don't just solve immediate business\n30\nproblems, but continually innovate and architect for \nchallenges that may emerge in the future. We build it \nfor ourselves first, and then, deeply rooted in our own \nexperience, take it widely to our clients. \nThe awesome possibilities of generative AI, we know from \nour own journey to becoming an AI-first enterprise, is not \nwithout its risks. The problems of AI hallucination, systemic \nbiases, lack of explainability along with plenty of practical, \nethical and intellectual property-related issues remain open \nand up for debate. We also know, from our experience, \nthat the path to scaling AI enterprise-wide is non-linear. \nOften, organizations, seeking to mine value from data and \nAI models, successfully undertake pilots but fail to factor in \nwhat it will take to scale value across the whole enterprise. \nAs demands increase, data volumes grow, and complexity \nrises, companies find themselves unable to surmount the \nassociated challenges and start to question the path to \nvalue. Navigating to value-at-scale from AI and retaining \nthe larger strategic vision while breaking down the tasks \ninto sequential small wins, is not always intuitive or simple. \nWith our AI-first strategy, Infosys is guided by that road \nmap. We are also bringing to our global clients the ability \nto accelerate business value and amplify human potential \nusing AI technologies with Infosys TopazTM.\nThe digital transformation of every industry and every \nbusiness, over the last several years, has laid the foundation \nto create optionality as we navigate the way forward. \nOur clients have always trusted us to assist them not only \nto make the right digital investments but to safeguard \nthese investments for their future. Today, we are excited \nby the opportunity and humbled by the responsibility we \nhave to enable them to bring all their digital capabilities \ntogether to execute quickly and effectively for now, while \ndeveloping multiple options to amplify their competitive \nadvantage and market leadership in an uncertain future. \nOur client relevance has never been so compelling, our \ninvestment in employees as continuous and consistent, \nand our purpose so keen. We are ready to co-create with \nour clients and our entire ecosystem a flexible future that \nputs people first and benefits the broader society even as \nit propels business forward. After all, like many have said, \nimagination is our invisible power to create all things. Our \nfuture can be as bright as we imagine it to be.\nNandan M. Nilekani\nBengaluru\nMay 29, 2023\nChairman\nInfosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23\nInfosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23\nNandan M.

{"text": "Performance overview\nLetter to the Shareholder\nDear shareholder,\nFinancial year 2023 was a strong year for our business.\nIn FY23, we saw growth of over 15%, operating margins \nof 21%, and free cash flow of US$2.5 billion. Our attrition \nreduced for each quarter of the year.\nWith the changing economic environment, we positioned \nour Company to work with clients for their digital \ntransformation as well as their cost efficiency and \nautomation programs, enabling us to support them in two \ncritical areas of interest.\nWe have developed a strong set of capabilities in \ngenerative artificial intelligence to enhance how we enable \nour clients to derive value. These capabilities are available \nto all our clients in the form of Infosys TopazTM.\nOur Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate \nwith our clients. Our platforms, including Finacle for banks, \nMcCamish for insurance, Equinox for commerce, and Helix \nfor healthcare, are creating strong impact with clients. \nDuring the year, we were recognized by Brand Finance \namong the top three most valuable IT services brands \nglobally.\nWe continue to deepen our engagement with our clients. \nThe number of clients with over US$100 million in revenue \nfor the year was at 40. The number of clients with over \nUS$50 million in revenue for the year was at 75. Our large \ndeal intensity was strong during the year. We had 95 large \ndeals with a value of US$9.8 billion in the year. We see \nour One Infosys approach helping support our clients by \nbringing all our capabilities and the strength of our entire \nemployee-base to work for their benefit.\nWe recruited over 50,000 college graduates in the year and \nended the year with over 3,40,000 employees. At the end \nof the year, 39% of our employees were women.\n32\nOur learning ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning \ndays for our employees during the year. \nLast year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders \u2013 \nUS$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our \nshare buyback program.\nAt the end of the financial year, we were the leading \ncompany among our peers in total shareholder return over \nthe past five years.\nWe remain committed to the communities we live and \noperate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we \nsupport a variety of social causes, including creating \npositive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and \nwomen empowerment. Our Infosys Springboard initiative \ncontinues to help build digital skills by providing free \nlearning programs to millions of people around the world.\nIn the past few quarters, we have seen the global \neconomy dealing with inflation, interest rate increases, \nand changes in demand environment for companies in \nvarious industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in \nautomation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have \nheld us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in \nthe evolving economic environment.\nAs I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the \ndedication of our employees, the strength of our \ncapabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance \nof our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our \nclients and continue to create impact for them.\nWith my warmest regards,\n[{\"type\": \"columnHeader\", \"row_index\": 0, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"o\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 1, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"Bengaluru\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 2, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"Viay 29, 2025 Chier executive Ofricer and IVial\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 3, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 4, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 5, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 6, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 7, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 8, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 9, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 10, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 11, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}, {\"type\": \"data\", \"row_index\": 12, \"column_index\": 0, \"row_span\": 1, \"column_span\": 1, \"content\": \"L\", \"bbox_format\": \"X1,Y1,X2,Y2\", \"bbox\": []}]\nInfosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23\nSd/-\nSalil Parekh\nChief Executive Officer and \nManaging Director\nInfosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23\n33", "metadata": {"chunk_id": "C-36aa2", "page_no": 3, "sequence_no": 1, "bbox_format": "X1,Y1,X2,Y2", "bbox": null, "doc_name": "AR_2022-23_page-14-17.pdf", "document_id": "6f158336-b7d1-45ec-8371-b85352a7e3d0", "chunking_method": "page", "char_count": "3", "resources": [{"type": "url_file_path", "path": "6f158336-e28a-4fa2-b42e-805cd53c6feb.pdf"}], "custom_metadata": {"year": "2023", "company_name": "infosys"}, "source": "/data/temp/954a9ae5-a750-436a-8c57-bb96200bcb80.txt"}}
